The Java Bindings for libspnav are written and maintained by
Michael Arndt <scriptkiller@gmx.de>, please contact me in case
of questions or problems.

To build the JAR SpaceNav.jar which contains the native library and
the Java classes please edit the Makefile and supply a valid path
for your Java SDK, then just type "make".

In the directory example, there is an example that can be run with
"make run".
