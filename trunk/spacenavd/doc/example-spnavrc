# This is an example configuration file for spacenavd. Uncomment and change
# any settings you need and copy it to /etc/spnavrc.
#
# Note that it's much easier to configure sensitivities and figure out axis
# reversals by using the interactive configure utility "spnavcfg", which lets
# you fiddle with all the settings and see the result immediately.

# Lines that start with a `#' are comments, and are ignored by spacenavd.


# Sensitivity is multiplied with every motion (1.0 normal).
#sensitivity = 1.0


# Separate sensitivity for rotation and translation.
#sensitivity-translation = 1.0
#sensitivity-rotation = 1.0


# Dead zone; any motion less than this number is discarded as noise.
#dead-zone = 2


# Selectively invert translation and rotation axes. Valid values are
# combinations of the letters x, y, and z.
#invert-rot = yz
#invert-trans = yz


# Swap Y and Z axes
#swap-yz = false


# Serial device
# Set this only if you have a serial device, and make sure you specify the
# correct device file. If you do set this option, any USB devices will be
# ignored!
#serial = /dev/ttyS0


# Enable/disable LED light (for devices that have one).
#led = on
