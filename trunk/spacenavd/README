spacenavd - 0.3
---------------

1. About
  Spacenavd, is a free software replacement user-space driver (daemon), for
  3Dconnexion's space-something 6dof input devices. It's compatible with the
  original 3dxsrv proprietary daemon provided by 3Dconnexion, and works
  perfectly with any program that was written for the 3Dconnexion driver.

2. Dependencies
  In order to compile the spacenavd daemon, you'll need the following:
    * GNU C Compiler
    * GNU make
    * Xlib headers (optional)

  You can compile the daemon without Xlib, but it won't be compatible with
  applications that where written for the original proprietary 3Dconnexion
  driver (e.g. blender, maya, etc). The 3dxsrv compatibility interface needs to
  go through the X window system.

3. Installation
  If you have the dependencies installed, just run ``make'' to compile the
  daemon, and ``make install'', to install it. The default installation prefix
  is ``/usr/local''. If you wish to install somewhere else, just change the
  PREFIX variable in the first line of the Makefile.

4. Running spacenavd
  If your system uses SysV init, then everything should be set up to have
  spacenavd start automatically during system startup. However, for now, you
  won't have to reboot, just type ``/etc/init.d/spacenavd start'' as root, to
  start the daemon immediately.

  If your system uses BSD init (you can tell if you *don't* have a series of
  directories called rc0.d, rc1.d, and so on, in /etc), then you'll have to
  follow your init documentation and set this up yourself. You may be able to
  use the provided init_script file as a starting point.

  Depending on how your system startup process is set up, it might be the case
  that the spacenavd daemon starts before the X server (for instance if you
  don't use a graphical login). In that case the daemon will start properly, but
  won't connect to the X server until explicitly told to do so. You can do that
  by running ``spnavd_ctl x11 start'' as root, or by using the graphical
  spnavcfg program. You don't really want to have to do that all the time
  though, so it's a better idea to add the aforementioned spnavd_ctl command to
  either your ~/.xsession or ~/.xinitrd file, or the system-wide
  /etc/X11/Xsession file.

5. Configuration
  The spacenavd daemon reads a number of options from the /etc/spnavrc file. If
  that file doesn't exist, then it uses default values for everything. You may
  use the graphical spnavcfg program to interactively set any of these options.
  The daemon should respond immediately to your changes, and also the
  configuration file should be updated automatically.

  nuclear@member.fsf.org along with a copy of your /tmp/spnav.log and any other
  relevant information.
