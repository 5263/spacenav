Freespaced, is a free software replacement user-space driver (daemon), for
3Dconnexion's space-something input devices. It's made compatible to the
original 3dxsrv proprietary daemon provided by 3Dconnexion, in order to work
flawlessly with any program that is based on the accompanying Magellan SDK.
